# Web Experiments Base Project

A `Babel` + `Sass` + `WebPack Dev Server` boilerplate.

I've created this project to have something I can use when the online playgrounds are down due to service issues, or just simply suffering from high load.

## Usage

1. Before first run execute `npm install` to install the dependencies
2. Execute `npm start` to start the WebPack Dev Server
3. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
4. Start playing with the `index.html`, `index.js` and `style.scss`

Or you can run `npm build` to have your `.js` and `.css` files generated to the `./dist` folder.
